This repository contains the data of real drone flights acquired for the work "ORION: Drone Trajectory Verification via Remote Identification Messages".

The repository contains three files:
- allowed_traj_1: data gathered by walking with a drone a set of allowed paths.
- allowed_traj_2: data gathered by cycling with the drone on a set of allowed paths.
- disallowed_traj: data gathered by flying with a drone on a set of disallowed paths, closer or farther from the allowed paths.

Each of the files contains the following fields:
- acquisition timestamp, in milliseconds;
- latitude coordinate, in decimal degrees north;
- longitude coordinate, in decimal degrees north;

For any questions, contact s.sciancalepore@tue.nl

Enjoy with the code!
